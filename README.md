## Why another blog?

A simple markdown blog written with Go, using HTMX and Gin.
Inspired by my latest trip to Viet Nam, I wanted to create a simple blog that I could use to document my travels and share my experiences with others.

### Why Go?
- I have recently started learning Go and wanted to build something simple yet useful with it.

### Reference

This [blog](https://arc.net/l/quote/dzcjmird) has been my reference for creating this project the way it is.

Alright, enough info for now. XD
